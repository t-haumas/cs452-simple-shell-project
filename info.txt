I did this:

@t-haumas ➜ /workspaces/cs452-simple-shell-project (master) $ sudo sysctl vm.mmap_rnd_bits
vm.mmap_rnd_bits = 32
@t-haumas ➜ /workspaces/cs452-simple-shell-project (master) $ sudo sysctl vm.mmap_rnd_bits=28
vm.mmap_rnd_bits = 28
@t-haumas ➜ /workspaces/cs452-simple-shell-project (master) $ sudo sysctl vm.mmap_rnd_bits
vm.mmap_rnd_bits = 28


Changed it from 32 to 28.
